# BlackJack Coursework #

This Java Coursework is for the Programming 2 Module at University of East Anglia .

### Coursework Description ###

Design and implement a simulation of the card game 'BlackJack'.
The game should consist of three levels, 'Basic, Intermediate and Advanced'. 
As the level increases, so to does the complexity of the moves that the computer makes against the player,
simulating an AI experience for the player. 
The program should utilise Serilisation and the advanced player should use a simplistic form of card counting. 
``` I added a human game to allow for multiplayer use of the game.```

### Running ###

To run the game, clone the repo to a PC with an IDE that has the Java SDK set up. 
You will find the coursework is split into two sections, Question 1 and Question 2.
Question 1 simulates creation of a Card Deck and in turn the shuffling, Serialisation and loading of that deck. 
You can run Quewstion 1 by running the `Deck.java` file.
When ran, question 1 will output a long text output displaying the full decks and the iterating through it as specified above. 

Question 2 when ran will require interaction from the player to run through the game. 
You can run Question2 by running the `BlackJackTable.java` file.
Via the command run UI, enter choices as instructed and it will allow you to simulate a BlackJack game.
This game can have either varying levels of computer difficulty or, if you chose the Human mode, can be played with another person.
